# YegnaBiz Deployment Guide

This guide walks through preparing production-ready build artifacts and hosting the Next.js application. It consolidates the configuration notes spread across the repository into one checklist so you can confidently deploy to Vercel, a VM, or any Node.js host.

## Quick Start

Choose the workflow that matches your target environment:

- **Docker Compose (all-in-one stack):**
  1. `cp .env.docker.example .env.docker` and fill in real secrets.
  2. `docker compose run --rm app npm run setup-admin` to seed admin credentials (optional but recommended).
  3. `docker compose up -d --build` to launch the Next.js app and the bundled MailHog SMTP sink.
  4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` and open MailHog at `http://localhost:8025` to inspect contact-form emails.
  5. Shut down with `docker compose down` when finished.

- **Node.js host / traditional deployment:**
  1. Copy `env.example` to `.env.production` (or configure equivalent host secrets) and provide real reCAPTCHA, JWT, and SMTP values.
  2. Run `npm install && npm run build` on your build machine or CI server.
  3. Provision persistent storage (JSON files under `data/` or configure PostgreSQL) and execute `npm run setup-admin` if you rely on the JSON store.
  4. Start the production server with `npm run start -- --hostname 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT:-3000}` behind your preferred reverse proxy.

The following sections expand on each step and cover additional checks for production readiness.

## 1. Prerequisites
- **Node.js 18+** and **npm** on the build machine.
- Optional: **PostgreSQL 15+** if you do not want to rely on the JSON files stored under `data/`.
- Production SMTP credentials for the contact form.

## 2. Configure Environment Variables
1. Copy `env.example` to the appropriate environment file for your target (e.g., `.env.production` locally or provider secrets in Vercel).
2. Fill in:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` and `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY` for Google reCAPTCHA v2.
   - `JWT_SECRET` with a long random value for signing auth tokens.
   - Contact email settings (`CONTACT_RECIPIENT_EMAIL`, `SMTP_FROM_EMAIL`, `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, `SMTP_SECURE`).
   - `DATABASE_URL` pointing at PostgreSQL when deploying to Vercel or any environment where the local JSON files would be ephemeral.
   - Optional connection tuning: set `DATABASE_SSL=true` for managed hosts that require TLS (Vercel Postgres ships with `?sslmode=require` by default) and `DATABASE_POOL_MAX` if you need to cap concurrent connections.
3. Commit secrets to your hosting provider, not to source control.

> **Tip:** The contact form API route requires `SMTP_HOST` and `SMTP_PORT`. Missing values will make requests fail with a 500 response.

## 3. Prepare Data (Optional but Recommended)
If you are using the JSON data store locally, create or reset admin credentials before deployment:

```bash
npm run setup-admin
```

The script writes `data/admin-users.json` with hashed credentials you can share securely with your team. When `DATABASE_URL` is present, the same command transparently switches to PostgreSQL, ensures the schema exists, and inserts the same starter data without touching the JSON files.

## 4. Build the Application
Run the production build locally or in CI to validate configuration:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

The build script automatically cleans previous artifacts and runs `scripts/ensure-next-assets.mjs` so CSS bundles generated during the build are copied to predictable names for deployment.

## 5. Start the Production Server (Self-Hosted)
If you are hosting on your own infrastructure:

```bash
# Ensure environment variables are exported or stored in a .env.production file
npm run start -- --hostname 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT:-3000}
```

Run the command under a process manager such as systemd or PM2 and place a reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy, etc.) in front for TLS termination.

## 6. Deploying to Vercel
1. Provision a [Vercel Postgres](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres) database (or supply your own managed PostgreSQL instance) and copy the `DATABASE_URL` connection string.
2. In the Vercel dashboard, add the production & preview environment variables listed above, including `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, and the SMTP/reCAPTCHA secrets.
3. Seed the database once before your first deploy:
   - Locally, export `DATABASE_URL` (and `DATABASE_SSL=true` if required) and run `npm run seed`. The script will connect to PostgreSQL, create any missing tables, and upsert the default admin user plus sample companies.
   - Alternatively, run the SQL files in `scripts/` (`01-create-tables.sql` then `02-seed-data.sql`) against your database with `psql` if you prefer managing the seed data manually.
4. Connect the repository to Vercel or run the `vercel` CLI. Deployments will run `npm install` and `npm run build` automatically.
5. JSON files in `data/` remain available for local development, but they are ignored whenever `DATABASE_URL` is present. All admin mutations in production will persist through PostgreSQL.

## 7. Deploying to Other Hosts
1. Upload the repository (or CI build artifacts) to your server.
2. Run the commands from sections 2â€“5 during provisioning.
3. Optionally configure PostgreSQL using the scripts in `scripts/` if you require a relational backend.
4. Configure log rotation and health monitoring suitable for your host.

## 8. Post-Deployment Checks
- Visit `/`, `/companies`, `/dashboard`, and `/contact` to confirm routing works.
- Submit the contact form with reCAPTCHA enabled to verify SMTP connectivity and rate limiting behaviour.
- Check that security headers declared in `next.config.mjs` (CSP, HSTS, Permissions-Policy, etc.) appear in responses.
- If using PostgreSQL, run the SQL setup scripts in `scripts/` and confirm API endpoints under `/api/admin/*` return data.

## 9. Deploy with Docker Compose (Full Stack)

The repository now ships with a production-ready Docker image and a companion `docker-compose.yml` file that runs the Next.js application together with a local MailHog SMTP sink. This gives you a single command that boots the frontend, API routes, and a test mail server.

1. Copy `.env.docker.example` to `.env.docker` and update the secrets (`JWT_SECRET`, reCAPTCHA keys, SMTP sender/recipient addresses, etc.).
2. (Optional but recommended) Initialise admin credentials in the mounted `data/` volume:
   ```bash
   docker compose run --rm app npm run setup-admin
   ```
3. Build and start the stack in the background:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```
4. The application is now available on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you set via `APP_PORT`). The MailHog web UI lives on `http://localhost:8025` (override with `MAILHOG_UI_PORT`) so you can verify contact-form emails without touching a real SMTP inbox.
5. When promoting to production, replace the MailHog settings in `.env.docker` with your real SMTP host (`SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`) or remove the MailHog service and point the app at your provider.
6. When you are done, stop the containers with `docker compose down`. The `data/` directory on the host persists admin JSON files across restarts.

Following the checklist above ensures the application is ready for production regardless of the hosting provider you choose.
